### Code Contributions

#### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/legal-summarizer.git
   cd legal-summarizer
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python download_nltk_data.py
   ```

4. **Create a new branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

#### Development Guidelines

- **Follow PEP 8** Python style guidelines
- **Write clear, descriptive commit messages**
- **Add comments** for complex logic
- **Update documentation** when necessary
- **Test your changes** thoroughly

#### Code Style

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Use type hints where appropriate

Example:
```python
def extract_text_from_pdf(file_path: str) -> str:
    """
    Extract text content from a PDF file.
    
    Args:
        file_path (str): Path to the PDF file
        
    Returns:
        str: Extracted text content
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the file doesn't exist
        PyPDF2.errors.PdfReadError: If PDF is corrupted
    """
    # Implementation here
```

#### Testing

- Test your changes with different file types (.txt, .pdf, .docx)
- Verify both extractive and abstractive summarization work
- Check the web interface functionality
- Test with various document sizes

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your code follows the guidelines above**
2. **Update the README.md** if you've added new features
3. **Commit your changes** with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of what you added"
   ```

4. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Open a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title and description
